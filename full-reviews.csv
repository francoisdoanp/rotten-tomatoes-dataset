1,The Invisible man,1,"The last time Universal tried to reinvent its classic monster series, it came up with 2017’s The Mummy, starring Tom Cruise, who probably wished his face was covered in bandages to disguise his participation. But hold off on the doomsaying regarding the studio’s “Dark Universe” reboot. Leigh Whannell’s The Invisible Man is a chilling mind-bender that strikes at our deepest fears — the ones we can’t see. The Australian writer-director co-created the Saw and Insidious franchises with James Wan; proved he had real directing chops with 2018’s Upgrade, a futuristic action thriller that went beyond the call of genre duty. He doesn’t resort to torture porn to update the famous H.G. Wells tale of a power-mad scientist who invents an invisibility cloak. Whannell and Co. are after way-scarier shit — namely, toxic masculinity. In tandem with horror maestro Jason Blum of Blumhouse (Get Out, Split, Paranormal Activity), Whannell revamps the story by flipping its focus. He gives a woman in peril all the power. The movie starts by reducing the title character — wealthy optics innovator Adrian Griffin (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) — to a supporting role. The spotlight shifts instead to Cecilia Kass (Elisabeth Moss), a San Francisco architect who has unwittingly become Adrian’s live-in prisoner and the subject of his perverse, controlling abuse. Adrian decides how she walks, talks, and dresses. Disobedience comes with death threats. No wonder Cecilia plans an escape from the pumpkin shell of Adrian’s seaside cliff house. With the help of her sister, Emily (Harriet Dyer), the frightened Cecilia hides out in the modest digs of cop-friend James (Aldis Hodge) and his teen daughter, Sydney (Storm Reid). Then the news comes: Adrian, presumably depressed over Cecilia’s desertion, has killed himself. He’s also left his former girlfriend-captive a $5 million chunk of his fortune. Is he really dead? For a while, both Cecilia and the audience are left to twist in the wind on that question, though Adrian’s creepy lawyer brother, Tom (Michael Dorman), has an urn of the scientist’s ashes in his possession. The residual effects of sleeping with the enemy take a toll as Cecilia begins to see things that may not be there. Is it all in her mind? Or has Adrian found a way to torment Cecilia with his cleverest invention: an optics machine that allows him to hide in plain sight? For a movie to send out a blast of bone-chilling, pulse-pounding terror peppered with psychological insights, it needs virtuosity in every department. And that’s what Whannell gets from cinematographer Stefan Duscio (Upgrade), production designer Alex Holmes (The Babadook), and composer Benjamin Wallfisch (Blade Runner 2049). But The Invisible Man owes its power to the uncommon talent and ingenuity of Moss. She’s dynamite, suggesting the emotional buffeting that Cecelia has endured and the strength of will it takes to fight back against forces she can’t control. Indelible on Mad Men, an Emmy winner for The Handmaid’s Tale, and superb in films as diverse as The Square and Her Smell, Moss is up to every challenge, delivering an electrifying performance as a woman pushed to the edge. Like Lupita Nyong’o (Us), Toni Collette (Hereditary), and Florence Pugh (Midsommar), the actor digs so deeply into the human condition that her raw-nerved portrayal bursts the bounds of the horror genre. She refuses to reduce Cecilia to clichés of either female hysteria or avenging angel. No fair spoiling the surprises that Moss and Whannell have in store, except to say that this story of a woman who needs to be heard and believed is as timely as Harvey Weinstein in handcuffs. Whannell has hit on a powerfully resonant theme: that the invisible scars an abused woman carries in her mind remain long after physical wounds have healed. The subtextual baggage makes the film, running just over two hours, heavy-going at times, especially when it drifts into formula jolts. But when the violence comes suddenly, often bloody and slashing, witnesses point to what they can see, not what they can’t. Just as 1954’s horror landmark Invasion of the Body Snatchers saw unfeeling duplicates of humans as symbols of conformity to anti-communist paranoia, The Invisible Man 2020 sees the scourge of turning a blind eye to domestic violence and the need for female empowerment. The dark universe of The Invisible Man doesn’t need monsters to keep us up nights. The terror comes from a world that looks exactly like our own."
2,Fantasy Island,0,"If crimes against cinema merited prosecution, Blumhouse’s Fantasy Island would go directly to death row. It defies common sense why Blumhouse, the company that boasts Get Out, The Purge, and Paranormal Activity on its horror roster, would put its stamp on this pathetic imitation of scare cinema. The idea was to jam horror jolts into the old Fantasy Island TV series, which dabbled in the supernatural when it wasn’t ripping off The Love Boat by stranding D-list guest stars in clichéd stories. ABC’s Fantasy franchise, which ran from 1977 to 1984 (B.C. to millennials), starred Ricardo Montalban as the mysterious Mr. Roarke, and Hervé Villechaize as his diminutive French assistant Tattoo, who would run up to a bell tower and shout, “Zee plane! Zee plane!” every time new guests arrived on their Pacific island to see their fantasies come true — for a price, of course: 50 grand. No one pays in this rebooted version, except audiences. All five passengers are winners of a TV contest to realize their fantasies on a gorgeous island (it’s Fiji!). All five are — surprise — hot bodies with deficiencies in the brains department, since they barely question their host, Mr. Roarke, now played by a white-suited and way overqualified Michael Peña, and his assistant, Julia (Parisa Fitz-Henley), when the pair warn about being careful what you wish for. Douchey Bradley (Ryan Hansen) and his gay stepbrother Brax (Jimmy O. Yang) just want to party like it’s spring break forever, man. Career exec Elena (Maggie Q) craves a second chance to accept a marriage proposal she rejected five years ago. Cop Patrick (Austin Stowell) longs to be a soldier and fight alongside his dead father in combat. And Melanie (Lucy Hale) wants to exact torture-porn revenge on bullying high-school mean girl Sloane (Portia Doubleday). A wussified PG-13 rating means none of these scenarios can deliver as much action as they might promise on the surface. Did the filmmakers go back to the future and learn how a hard R-rating doomed the box-office hopes of Birds of Prey? For whatever reason, in this thrill-free rehash that reaches career-crushing lows in writing, directing, and acting, lame is the name of the game. It’s hard to believe that director Jeff Wadlow (Truth or Dare) needed two co-screenwriters, Chris Roach and Jillian Jacobs, to cobble together this padded twaddle. Their claptrap script hardly qualifies as a first draft. A machete-wielding psycho, played by Michael Rooker, runs around the island connecting the stories, and trying to chop everything to bits. Is he the real author of the screenplay? Wadlow’s lazy excuse for a movie hits a brick wall of incoherence long before a climactic twist that’s been telegraphed from Scene One. The only genuine, blood-curdling scream incited by this stupefyingly dull time- and money-waster comes at the end, when the notion dawns that Blumhouse’s Fantasy Island is meant to spawn sequels. Stop it now, before it kills again."
3,Downhill,0,"Hollywood knockoffs of foreign-language films almost never work. Remember the recent Miss Bala (based on Mexico’s 2012 Oscars submission of the same name) and The Upside (the Kevin Hart/Bryan Cranston version of the 2011 French hit The Intouchables)? Downhill, an Americanized remake of 2014’s brilliant Force Majeure, turns Swedish director Ruben Östlund’s black-comic provocation into a bland muddle. Östlund’s prickly moral fable felt like if Ingmar Bergman directed a National Lampoon’s Ski Vacation. The dreary and disconcertingly unfunny Downhill leaves you feeling nothing. The rich possibilities in the casting of Will Ferrell and Julia Louis-Dreyfus — comic icons with genuine dramatic chops (see: him in Stranger Than Fiction and her in Enough Said) — go frustratingly unexplored. Instead, co-directors Jim Rash and Nat Faxon — the Oscar-winning screenwriters of Alexander Payne’s The Descendants — don’t seem to know what to do with the script they shaped from an initial go-round by Succession creator Jesse Armstrong. Downhill is sure as hell not the farce it’s been advertised to look like in the trailer. And you’ll search in vain for Force Majeure’s grounding in existential crisis. I don’t know what the Swedes would call Downhill. What’s Swedish for an unholy mess? Louis-Dreyfus and Ferrell play Billie and Pete Stanton, a middle-class couple with enough disposable income to take their two sons, Finn (Julian Grey) and Emerson (Ammon Jacob Ford), on a weeklong ski vacation in Austria. Fissures in the marriage can be seen in the tense lines around Billie’s mouth when Pete’s reliance on checking his smartphone amounts to an addiction. But they go through the motions — until an incident on day two of their vacation. With all four Stantons about to enjoy lunch on a mountainside terrace, they witness a controlled avalanche that seems to be not so controlled. In fact, it’s coming right at them. The approach prompts Pete to grab his phone and run like a rabbit in ski boots, leaving his wife and kids to face their fate without him. When the snow clears, Billie and the kids are shaken but unharmed. But Pete’s cowardice hangs in the air like an accusation that remains unspoken, at least at first. The blunt-force impact of the scene is as effective in Downhill as it is in Force Majeure, the latter film’s title referencing a legal term for an extraordinary event or act of God that prevents parties from fulfilling a contract. Pete’s actions are a betrayal of his contract as a husband and father. Östlund gave the scene a bite that left marks, not just on the theme of fragile masculinity but on marriage itself. The softer approach of Naxon and Rash dulls that edge. Ferrell has played the man-child before, from Old School to Step Brothers, and the familiarity of his casting brings a comic note to Pete that pushes toward forgiveness. Veep star Louis-Dreyfus fares better, especially when Billie lets her husband have it in front of their sons, Pete’s coworker Zach (Zach Woods), and Zach’s girlfriend Rosie (Zoe Chao). For a moment, Downhill blazes into blistering life. But the film quickly reverts to safe territory. The always-welcome Miranda Otto shows up as comic relief in the role of Charlotte (pronounced Char-lotta), an oversexed resort director who encourages Billie to get it on with hottie Italian ski instructor Guglielmo (Giulio Berruti) while Pete gets drunk with Zach and falls all over himself like a harmless buffoon. This is the stuff of sitcom, a cop-out that lowers the emotional stakes. Wishing to be an uncompromising art film doesn’t make it so. At 85 minutes, Downhill feels at least an hour longer by leading audiences and two talented stars down the slippery slope of conflicting intentions. Where Force Majeure went for broke, Downhill hedges its bets. For audiences, it’s a wipeout."
4,Bad boys for life,1,"Before he became a cynical parody of himself, director Michael Bay made an efficient 1995 feature debut with Bad Boys, a buddy-cop flick that came in hot on the star power of Will Smith and Martin Lawrence as Miami detectives who never learned how to play by the rules. By the time the 2003 sequel Bad Boys 2 rolled around, Bay had become the Bay we know and loathe (remember Pearl Harbor?) and buried the duo’s chemistry in his patented brand of violent noise, racial profiling, sexist smarm and dumb dick jokes. Bad Boys For Life, the third chapter in the series, doesn’t exactly dodge those flaws, though it does move past them. It also raises two questions: Does anyone even remember Bad Boys after 25 years? And will anyone care that this franchise is back? It’s a shock to report that, yes, you will care. The first smart decision that this new entry makes is kicking Bay to the curb. Though the filmmaker does a cameo in (mock?) tribute to his contributions, he’s been replaced by film-school colleagues Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah, Moroccan-born directors who like being billed as Adil and Bilall. These thirtysomething Muslims, raised in Belgium, have a Bay-like need to blow shit up. But their movie still feels touched by human hands, which is saying a lot given the standard-issue plot, clumsy dialogue and right-wing politics festering in the script by Chris Bremner, Peter Craig and Joe Carnahan, Better yet, the duo know how to bring out the best in their stars by staying out their way and letting them fly. And boy, do they ever. Smith is back as Mike Lowery, the loose-cannon cop who never grew up, still punching his weight even if he has to color his greying goatee with Cocoa Bean hair dye. Lawrence is Marcus Burnett, his straight-arrow partner who’s now a new granddaddy with fading eyesight and car sickness. He’s ready to retire from the Miami PD. Mike is horrified at the idea of his friend hanging it up to sit in a Barcalounger watching telenovas. Age is creeping up on them. Before you think you’re watching a cop version of The Irishman, however, Mike and Marcus are propelled to take on one last case. It’s a near-successful attempt on Mike’s life to that brings these two back together. The culprit is Isabel Aretas (Kate del Castillo), the wife of a Mexican cartel lord that Mike put in the slammer. She’s instructed her hair-triggered son, Armando (Jacob Scipio), to assassinate everyone involved, including the judge and a forensics expert. But she wants to save Mike for last. This time, it’s personal. As to why it’s so personal, let’s just say that the film’s climax — a mix of Greek tragedy and Smith’s godawful Gemini Man — achieves a level of flamboyant idiocy that you’d laugh off the screen if Smith and Lawrence didn’t keep everything moving along so damn smoothly. Not to mention that it’s fun watching these law-enforcement geezers, including their captain (Joe Pantoliano), cope with the young Turks on the case. A special tactical police squad known as AMMO is in charge; it’s led by Mike’s ex, Rita (Paola Núñez). As for the new kids on the block, including Vanessa Hudgens, Alexander Ludwig and Charles Melton (he goads Mike by calling him grandpa) pull the codgers into a brave new world of computerized crime-solving and rubber bullets. Naturally, Mike and Marcus prefer doing it old-school, and the clash between the two camps energizes the movie. It’s a bumpy ride for sure, but Smith and Lawrence haven’t lost their irresistible mojo and Bad Boys For Life plays like a blast of retro ’90s action. It’s like they never left."
5,Knives out,1,"Both old-fashioned and tongue-in-cheek, Rian Johnson’s Knives Out is a spirited comic detective story that evokes Agatha Christie – not her novels but their all-star, movie-glam adaptations, from the 1974 Murder on the Orient Express to the recent Kenneth Branagh version of that same book. Daniel Craig is crafty as the Hercule Poirot stand-in, an apparently bumbling private detective with a plummy Southern American accent and the cartoonish name Benoit Blanc, who investigates the possible murder of a bestselling crime novelist, Harlan Thrombey. The victim is played by Christopher Plummer, first as a bloody corpse on a couch – on his 85th birthday, which also becomes his death day – and then in flashbacks as a patriarch who has decided to cut off the flow of money to his family. Everyone gathered in the Thrombeys’ big neo-Gothic house has a motive for murder. More important for the film, almost every one is sharply played by a familiar actor. Jamie Lee Curtis is Harlan’s businesslike daughter Linda, married to a cheating lout played by Don Johnson. Chris Evans is their son, deliciously named Ransom. A smarmy trust-fund boy, Ransom may be more interesting than Evans’s famous role as The Avengers’ bland Captain America. Michael Shannon is Harlan’s son Walt, who runs his father’s publishing empire, and Toni Collette is a daughter-in-law, the widow of Harlan’s other son, never quite accepted by the family. One lesser-known actor has a major role, which she carries off with the confidence of a star. Ana de Armas plays Marta, Harlan’s sincere young nurse, whose friendship is a relief from his family’s money-grubbing greed. In one of the funniest satiric threads, the Thrombeys frequently claim that Marta is part of the family, even though one of them says she is from Uruguay, the other thinks she’s from Paraguay and another from Brazil. The director, best known for Star Wars: The Last Jedi, started out making much smaller films that inventively toy with genre. Brick is a noir set in high school, and Looper a time-bending sci-fi about identity. Knives Out combines the big-name profile of Star Wars with that playfulness, involving the audience in the mystery while tossing in grace notes that undercut the genre elements. As we see each character’s memories, we grasp the distance between what happened and what little they are sharing with the detectives. We can try to piece things together, but Johnson’s screenplay constructs twists and turns that keep it ahead of the audience. Hints and red herrings are everywhere in the house, though, which is cluttered with old-timey touches like antique vases and posters of Harlan’s book jackets alongside droll pop details. A chair made of knives resembles the Iron Throne, an homage to Game of Thrones, which shares with Knives Out the idea of siblings in a deadly power grab. “The guy practically lives in a Clue board,” LaKeith Stanfield says as the police detective assigned to the case. Like much of Knives Out, that line is mildly clever, self-conscious, and a bit too on-the-nose. As Johnson ticks off conventional murder-mystery elements while making fun of them, he has the family gather for the reading of the will, which starts with the lawyer acknowledging that it’s really not necessary for everyone to be there. When Linda grandiosely refers to the Gothic pile as their ancestral home, Blanc points out that Harlan bought it in the 1980s. Very witty. But details like a creaky floorboard and characters who sneak out in the night, while knowing, are sometimes flat. Craig brings a touch of absurdity to the film, which could have used more of that goofy outrageousness. How did the Southern detective end up in a town near Boston? Who knows, but it’s a good thing he did. As in Steven Soderbergh’s 2017 caper Lucky Logan, Craig gleefully breaks free of James Bond. His over-the-top comic turn dominates the film and is often better than the rest of it. There are a few terrifically funny scenes, including a wildly confusing monologue by Blanc about the hole inside a doughnut hole. But much of Knives Out settles for being savvy and just fun enough. Best to remember that those old movies Johnson embraces were really not that great, and to bring lowered expectations to his entertaining but scattershot update.    "
6,1917,1,"The baby-faced soldier running toward the camera in 1917 perfectly captures what was so heart-breaking and haunting about World War One – all that innocence sent into battle, all those futures destroyed. Perhaps no film can capture the enormity of that war, which left around 17 million dead, and generations to grieve. Director Sam Mendes wisely takes the opposite approach, personalising the experience through two young British soldiers sent on a harrowing, high-stakes, night-long mission, he creates a film that is tense, exhilarating and profoundly moving. Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) is that baby-faced soldier. Schofield (George MacKay) is not much older but seems world-weary, having already been in combat. Mendes immerses viewers in the young soldiers’ experience when they are sent on foot across no-man’s land with a message that could prevent a slaughter. They must reach British forces at the front line before dawn with orders to call off a planned attack on the Germans, who have staged an ambush. With phone lines down, the fate of 1,600 men rests with these two messengers. Mendes’ audacious strategy behind the camera has already received a great deal of attention. Filming in extremely long takes and making as few editing cuts as possible, he creates the illusion of one continuous movement as the soldiers run through trenches and across muddy fields. The technique is dazzling, but it is more than a stunt. It enhances tension and immediacy, allowing us to feel connected to the two heroes. That connection is primarily thanks to the actors, though. Chapman (Game of Thrones) and MacKay (Captain Fantastic) are marvels of naturalness on screen. For Blake, the mission is personal because his brother is among the likely casualties if the attack goes forward. It’s a connection that the general who chose him for the mission (Colin Firth) ruthlessly exploited. In the early stretches of the journey, before the action and danger intensifies, Blake talks about home. Chapman’s rosy cheeks might have been enough to signal innocence, but the performance captures the unquestioning goodness of the character, too young to be in such danger, determined to save his older brother.  Schofield is quieter and has to be drawn out, reluctantly admitting that he won a medal for fighting at the Somme, a medal he doesn’t prize and no longer owns. Despite his disillusionment, he is just as committed to their mission and protective of Blake. His character has the greater trajectory in the film, and MacKay comes through with a quietly astonishing performance. When he grapples with a difficult question Blake poses, you can see his thoughts churning as he hesitates before answering. His face looks increasingly haunted with grief. In addition to Firth, Andrew Scott and Benedict Cumberbatch make brief appearances as British officers. But the film rightly belongs to Chapman and MacKay, whose lesser-known status helps us believe in their authenticity. If much of the advance publicity about 1917 has been about its technique, one reason may be that the most suspenseful and most wrenching episodes come as shocks. To be more detailed about why the film is so moving would be to give away too much. Another reason is that Mendes’ direction and Roger Deakins’ cinematography are truly astonishing. As Blake and Schofield set out through the trenches, the camera moves swiftly backwards with them as they race toward us. We feel their frantic pace as well as the claustrophobia of being on that narrow path with walls made of mud. When they emerge in no-man’s land, we are with them as they cross a vast landscape strewn with human corpses and dead horses. The light is a drama in itself, enhancing the feel of every scene, changing from the deep shadows in the room where Blake and Schofield get their orders, to deceptively bright skies, and eventually a huge plume of fire glowing orange against a pitch-black night sky. In addition to American Beauty and the underrated Jarhead, set during the Gulf War, Mendes has directed the last two James Bond films, Skyfall and Spectre. His experience with all that Bond action is put to good use in 1917, which for all its intimacy is laced with spectacular set pieces, with plane crashes and escapes while under enemy fire. 1917 is a tribute to sacrifice and heroism, but it is not naive about the brutal motives that are sometimes behind combat. Mark Strong, a captain along the heroes’ route to the front, advises that if the message is actually delivered, “Make sure there are witnesses,” so the order to stand down can't be ignored. “Some men just want the fight,” he says. More often, Mendes resists philosophising and lets the action – explosively around the heroes and subtly on their faces – express the fraught, complicated, terrifying condition of war. Like so many families, Mendes’ was touched by World War One. He dedicates the film to his grandfather, who told him stories about his own wartime experience. He has turned those passed-down memories into one of the most stirring films of the year. "
7,Dark Phoenix,0,"“Who are we?” wonders Jean Grey – the telepathic, telekinetic, soul-searching heroine of Dark Phoenix – in the film’s opening voiceover. Any telepath around could have looked into her mind and answered: “Well, you’re not someone interesting.” This latest instalment in the X-Men franchise is flatter than a wafer-thin page of the comic books that inspired it. The film is done in by a drab script and a surprisingly dull Sophie Turner, whose performance as Jean, aka Phoenix, supposedly in emotional turbulence as she sorts out whether to use her powers for good or evil, has none of the wiliness and depth Turner displayed as Sansa Stark on Game of Thrones. Dark Phoenix is especially disappointing because the X-Men series has always been the smartest, most sophisticated of today’s action-hero movies. That difference is largely thanks to James McAvoy’s cerebral Professor Charles Xavier, whose mind-control abilities make mental powers seem dynamic, and Michael Fassbender’s Erik Lehnsherr, who becomes Magneto. His haunted past drives his thoughts, and his ability to move giant chunks of metal. Charles and Magneto are in Dark Phoenix, along with other familiar characters. They include Jennifer Lawrence as the shape-shifting Raven, who tries to be a mentor to Jean. Nicholas Hoult is Hank or the Beast – sometimes looking human, sometimes blue and hairy. Tye Sheridan is Jean’s boyfriend, Scott, who can shoot powerful beams out of his eyes. But these characters seem to walk through the script, without the visceral connections that have made them a team – often split by rivalry – in the past. The story arc is so straightforward it’s hardly an arc at all. After a quick flashback to a trauma in Jean’s girlhood, which led her to Xavier’s school for powerful mutants (as it should properly be called), the plot picks up in 1992, a decade after the events of X-Men Apocalypse. The X-Men are launched into space to save a damaged US space shuttle, and while the mission succeeds there’s a nasty side effect. Jean absorbs solar flares that enhance her dark energy, making her the most powerful of mutants. For the rest of the film she struggles with how ‘good Jean’ can prevent ‘bad Jean’ from taking control and killing people. In an early scene, evil Jean tosses police cars in the air, smashes houses and kills a beloved major character – at least for now. Who really stays dead in action-hero sagas? Their landscapes are now littered with more formerly-dead characters than most zombie movies. The X-Men, ever philosophical, are split between wanting to save Jean from herself, or destroy her for the good of the world. It’s surprising that such a promising, character-driven premise never takes off, because the film was directed and written by Simon Kinberg, who has had a role producing or writing the X-Men films since The Last Stand in 2006. As a director, he lacks a flair for working with actors. Jessica Chastain is wasted in her role as an alien named Vuk who takes over the body of a human and befriends Jean, planning to use her powers to allow the aliens to take over the Earth. With an impassive expression throughout, Vuk never seems persuasive or dangerous. Kinberg does comes through with a couple of spectacular action scenes. Jean seeks out Magneto on an island where he and other mutants have found peace. (Fingers crossed for a reality series, Survivor: Mutant Island.) When military helicopters arrive to take Jean away, Magneto puts up his hands and fends them off. It seems that Fassbender can do anything, because he actually lets us see and believe in Magneto’s physical and emotional struggle in that scene. A bigger battle takes place in New York City, where Magneto, Charles and the other X-Men have tracked down Jean and Vuk. Magneto’s powers lift a subway train up out of the ground and send it hurtling into the front hall of a luxurious building across from Central Park. But two good action set pieces aren’t enough to keep things lively. The screen glows with fireballs of energy every 10 minutes or so, but the better special effects are imposed on Jean’s face. When her dark powers emerge, tiny lightning-like bolts appear on her face, as if it were being cracked by golden veins. Her eyes turn gold and glowing. It’s a creepy, effective image. At least Jean looks sinister, even if Turner gives her nothing behind that mask. Dark Phoenix brings in the themes that most action-hero movies rely on. There’s the question of how to use superhuman powers, balanced by the humanising conceit of the heroic team as a family. Will the family hold or break apart? Earlier, better X-Men films, notably First Class (2011), allowed audiences to feel invested in these issues and the outcome. Here, it’s hard to be engaged when the characters themselves seem so detached. Kinberg’s script has the occasional flash of wit and meta-awareness of the franchise’s history. When Magneto meets Charles again, his old friend and rival begins to explain why they should save Jean instead of killing her. Magneto says: “There’s always a speech.” And Raven snaps at Charles, “By the way, the women are always saving the men around here. You might consider changing the name to X-Women.” The line is calculated to please audiences, but it’s hollow. Phoenix goes through the uninspired motions of saving the world, but she can’t even save her own film."
